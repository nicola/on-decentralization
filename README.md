> Issues and notes on decentralization

## What is technological decentralization?
- Decentralization is about redistributing control between individuals and intermediaries that stand between the intention and the realization of an action
- What does decentralization address?

Problems
  - Control/Power
    - Dependence: e.g. vendor's lock in
      - data lock in
      - platform lock in
    - Monitoring: e.g. surveillance
      - read more than supposed to / knowing information that the user can avoid to share
    - Alteration/Integrity/Censorship
      - stop showing some content

Solutions / Effects
- Interoperability
- Portability
- Privacy/Anonymity

The security model has changed

## Motivations on moving towards decentralization

- Philosophy / Ideology
  - Foster Democracy
  - Freedom - what does it mean to have alternative or to avoid the alternative?
  - The role of intermediaries
  - Limiting innovation
  - Censorship

- Incentives
  - Economic incentive
    - The government
    - The market
    - The individuals
    - New work place

  - Delegation
  - The example of Dynamo

## The state of the art of Centralization

- "Firms arise when the individual cost of starting something is higher" - The nature of the firm
- is there a way for which the incentive of a company is to reduce the individual cost?

## The cost of Decentralization

- Questions
  - When does it make sense?
  - Does it lower the barriers for starting something?
  - When is decentralization important?

- New problems that arise
  - Governance
  - Scalability

## Topics in Decentralization

- Control
- Trust
- Interoperability
  - Data: semantic web,
  - Hardware
- Permanence
  
## The key to decentralization

- Technical implementation
  - More connectivity: more device connected and faster connection
  - Powerful cryptography: the field has been important
  
## Decentralization five stars

## Properties of decentralized systems

- Interoperability
- Partitionability
